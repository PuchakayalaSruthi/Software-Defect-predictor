# Software-Defect-predictor
A Novel approach for Software Defect Prediction using Machine Learning

# Overview
This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques for predicting software defects. Software defect prediction is a critical aspect of software development, as it helps identify potential issues early in the development lifecycle, allowing developers to take proactive measures to address them. By employing machine learning algorithms on historical data, this project aims to build predictive models that can identify patterns and factors contributing to software defects.

# Features
Data Collection: Gather historical data related to software development, including code metrics, bug reports, and other relevant information.

Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the collected data to make it suitable for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, feature scaling, and transforming data into a usable format for machine learning algorithms.

Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features from the data that can serve as predictors for software defects. This may include code complexity metrics, developer experience, code churn, and others.

Model Selection: Evaluate and select appropriate machine learning algorithms for building predictive models. Commonly used algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.

Model Training: Train the selected machine learning models on the preprocessed data to learn patterns and relationships between features and software defects.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained models using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This helps determine the effectiveness of the models in predicting software defects.

Deployment: Integrate the trained models into the software development process, allowing developers to leverage them for defect prediction. This may involve creating APIs or incorporating the models into existing development tools.

# Benefits
Early Detection: Predicting software defects early in the development lifecycle enables proactive measures to mitigate risks and improve software quality.

Resource Optimization: By identifying potential defect-prone areas, development resources can be allocated more efficiently to focus on critical areas of the codebase.

Continuous Improvement: Analyzing historical data and feedback from predictions can help refine the predictive models over time, leading to better accuracy and reliability.
